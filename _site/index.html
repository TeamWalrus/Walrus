<h1 id="project-walrus---card-cloning-made-simple">Project Walrus - Card Cloning Made Simple</h1>

<p>Walrus is an Android Application that simplifies using several existing contactless card cloning devices during red team engagements and physical security assessments. Walrus helps penetration testers make better use of card cloning devices such as the <a href="http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/proxmark3-kit/">Proxmark 3</a>, <a href="https://shop.kasper.it/chameleonmini/">Chameleon Mini</a>, <a href="https://www.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/rfid-hacking/attack-tools/">Tastic RFID Thief</a>, and more to come! Access cards can be cloned from supported devices and stored in a common database, to be used later in the field. The cloned card can be  written to a new blank card or emulated on another device such as the Proxmark, instantly granting the attacker privileged access to restricted areas.</p>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<h2 id="device-agnostic">Device Agnostic</h2>
<p>Walrus is device agnostic, meaning you can use a wide range of card cloning devices. Walrus currently supports the Proxmark3 and Chameleon Mini Rev.G and partial support for the Tastic RFID Theif. However, we are still developing the tool and plan on adding support for new devices such as the <a href="http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/blekey/">BLE-Key</a>, <a href="https://store.ryscc.com/collections/all/products/magspoof">MagSpoof v2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rfidtool/ESP-RFID-Tool/blob/master/README.md#esp-rfid-tool">RFID-Tool</a>.</p>

<h2 id="walk-by-cloning">‘Walk by’ Cloning</h2>
<p>Walrus can tap into the power of the Tastic RFID Thief long range card reader and allows for ‘walk by’ cloning of a victim’s access card in a matter of seconds. The cloned card can then be emulated or written to a new blank card via an attached Proxmark. Instructions on adding Bluetooth support to your Tastic RFID Thief for $3.47 can be found <a href="/lumpy/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw tune</code> :)</p>

<h2 id="bypass-the-8-card-slot-limit-of-the-chameleon-mini-revg">Bypass the 8 card slot limit of the Chameleon Mini Rev.G.</h2>
<p>Your Walrus wallet size is limited only by the amount of free storage on your device.
By default, Walrus will emulate cards on cardslot 1 of the attached Chameleon Mini device. However, this can be adjusted in the device settings:</p>

<h2 id="share-cards-coming-soon">Share cards (coming soon)</h2>
<p>In some situations, there might be two consultants on an engagement. One consultant can be tasked with cloning an access card from an employee using the RFID Tastic Theif. Once an access card has been obtained, the cloned card can be sent to the second consultant, who is waiting close by and is ready to write a new card or emulate the access card on a Proxmark.</p>
